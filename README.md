# SuperheroicCoding: Some examples with Angular+, Angular-Material, p5, three.js  

Just some cool examples implemented in Angular for topics that I am interested in. 

The topics are science algorithms like poisson distribution and reaction diffusion.
Also shader programming with webgl and AI are given. 
For visualization p5 and three.js are used.

I always try to keep a good code structure as defined in the Angular style guide.
Also I love rxjs and use it as much as I can.   
CSS wise I try to get my hands on grid layout.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version ^1.7.4.

A running version (not always up to date) can be found on github pages: https://superheroiccoding.github.io/AngularExamples/

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## ghPages
Run `npm run ghPages` to generate a version into docs folder that can be served from ghPages.
Copy the docs/index.html into 404.html to make it work on github.

## Service Worker
A serviceWorker configuration is generated if you run `ng build --prod`.
It is used to serve the page even when you are offline. 
You can test the service worker with `http-server -p 8080` from dist folder.

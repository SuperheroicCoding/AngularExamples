# SuperheroicCoding: Some examples with Angular+, Angular-Material, p5, three.js  

Just some cool examples for topics that I am interested in. 
The topics are science algorithms like poisson distribution and reaction diffusion.
For visualization p5 and three.js are used.
I always try to keep a good code structure as defined in the Angular styleguide.
Also I love rxjs and use it as much as I can.   
CSS wise I try to get my hands on grid layout.
